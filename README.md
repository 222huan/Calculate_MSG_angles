# Calculate_MSG_angles
Calculate view zenith angle (VZA), view azimuth angle (VAA), sun zenith angle (SZA), and sun azimuth angle (SAA) for MSG pixels.
In this project, the azimuth angles are defined within [0, 360), where the north is 0째, east is 90째, south is 180째, and west is 270째.

LSASAF doesn't provide such angle informations, which may be necessary in some work. Therefore, in this project, we calculate VZA, VAA, SZA, and SAA of MSG pixels.
